Problem 5-15:
(a): Answer is on the picture I submit in the assignment 7 file.

(b): (4 + 3) / 3 = 7 / 3 = 2.33 => Answer: 2.33

(c): (3 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33 => Answer: 1.33

(d): answer: We can only handled by specific functional units because 
the multiplication requires more complx hardare. 

Problem 5-16:
(a) answer: The reason why any version of any inner product procedure 
cannot achieve a CPE less than 2.00 is there are two vectors we dealing. One 
function we are asked is there is two vectors in our instead of one like they 
have. It multiplicate 2 vectors and the CPE 1.00 So that it will never go faster
than 2.0

Problem 5-17;
(a) answer: Beacause we are always deal with two vectors getting mutipled 
tegether. Just like problem 5-16, This multiplication for these two vectors is that 
holding use bake.

Problem 4:
answer: When we run all 3 of algorithms. It is shows that 5-15 is the slowest one
beacuse it have no optimizations. The rest two of algorithms overall put out the same
times beacause they all have a CPE of 2.00.
