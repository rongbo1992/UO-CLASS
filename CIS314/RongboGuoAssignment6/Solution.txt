problem2: Consider the following Y86 code:

addl %eax %eax
mrmovl 0(%ecx) %ebx
addl %ebx %eax

How many pipeline stalls (or bubbles) are required when running the above code	with and without forwarding (see sections 4.5.5-4.5.8)?

answer shows below:

when we run the code with forwarding it will have no pipeline stalls:
|f|d|e|m|w|
  |f|d|e|m|w|
    |f|d|e|m|w|

when we run the code without forwarding it will have 3 nop because we can only add after the the mrmovl memory finish. It succed at raw 6.
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|
|f|d|e|m|w|           // addl
  |f|d|e|m|w|         // mrmovl
    |f|d|e|m|w|       // nop
      |f|d|e|m|w|     // nop
        |f|d|e|m|w|   // nop 
          |f|d|e|m|w| // addl
